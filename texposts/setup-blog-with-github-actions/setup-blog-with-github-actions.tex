Git doesn't keep modification time in the repository. As we want to compile only modified
\LaTeX\ files, we need to restore the modification times. 
Thankfully, this is possible thanks to 
\href{https://github.com/chetan/git-restore-mtime-action}{git-restore-mtime action}
which can restore modification times from the file commit times.
