This is first in series of posts about blogging with \LaTeX\ using
\href{https://tug.org/tex4ht/}{\TeX4ht}. I've set it up as a showcase of
\TeX4ht features for \href{https://tug.org/tug2021/}{TUG 2021} conference.
I didn't show it in the end, because I ran out of the allocated time 
for the presentation length, and also didn't finish all posts on time. 
At the present time, the articles are drafts. I will update them over time,
but my progress, as usual with my writing, can be slow.

\section*{Why would you do such a crazy thing?}

I like to write my documents in \LaTeX, and I want to provide an alternative
to other markup languages. Contrary to some claims, it isn't hard to compile
\LaTeX\ to HTML, you just need to take some precautions.


\section*{Overview of the setup}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use \href{/testblog/2021/07/30/how-to-blog-with-tex4ht.html}
{\TeX4ht to produce files suitable for static site generators}.
\item Use static site generator, like \href{https://jekyllrb.com/}{Jekyll}
or \href{https://gohugo.io/}{Hugo}
, to produce a web site.
\item Use Github Actions to automatically compile \LaTeX\ files pushed
to the repository, and recompile the web site. 
\end{enumerate}

I will tell more on how to set up an automatic
blog publishing using Jekyll, Github Pages and Github Actions in the following posts.

The code for this blog is available at
\url{https://github.com/michal-h21/testblog}.

Notable files and directories are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/michal-h21/testblog/blob/main/.make4ht}{Build file for make4ht.}
  \item \href{https://github.com/michal-h21/testblog/tree/main/texposts}{\LaTeX\ documents root.}
  \item \href{https://github.com/michal-h21/testblog/blob/main/texposts/rebuild.sh}{Script which forces rebuild only changed files}.
    We don't want to compile all \LaTeX\ files on every blog update. 
  \item \href{https://github.com/michal-h21/testblog/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml}{Github Actions workflow file.}
\end{itemize}
